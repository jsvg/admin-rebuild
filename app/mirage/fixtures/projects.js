Age-related cataracts generally develop in men and women after their 40th birthday due to the progressive breakdown of the ocular lens structure. The prevalence of cataracts is expected to increase as life expectancy in both developed and underdeveloped countries continues to improve. Current treatment for senile cataracts generally consists of a surgery that replaces the opaque lens with an artificial intraocular lens. Although the surgery is performed routinely in the US at a rate of 1.8-2 million patients per year, it represents a major Medicare reimbursement category. It has been estimated by the National Eye Institute, NIH (Bethesda, MD) that a 10-year delay in the onset of cataracts could decrease the number of surgeries needed by almost one half, thus significantly decreasing vision care costs. The ?A crystalline is the most abundant structural component of the human lens; its abnormal function and\/or expression causes lens opacification.

Findings from this study might help in developing policies for the regulation of BPA use and be translated into prevention strategies for diabetes.","PI_IDS":"2270883; ","PI_NAMEs":"FERRARA, ASSIAMIRA ;","PROGRAM_OFFICER_NAME":"DILWORTH, CAROLINE H.","PROJECT_START":"11\/20\/2012","PROJECT_END":"10\/31\/2017","PROJECT_TERMS":"Accounting; Address; Adipocytes; adiponectin; Adipose tissue; Age; Alcohol consumption; Animals; biobank; Biological Markers; bisphenol A; Blood; blood glucose regulation; Blood specimen; Blood Tests; Body mass index; Case-Control Studies; Childhood; Cohort Studies; Cost Measures; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Endocrine Disruptors; Enrollment; Enzymes; Ethnicity aspects; Etiology; exposed human population; Exposure to; Family history of; Future; Gene Expression; Gestational Age; Gestational Diabetes; Glucose; glucose metabolism; Health; Hepatocyte; high risk; Human; Incidence; Infant; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Lead; Link; lipid metabolism; Liver; liver function; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolic Marker; Mothers; Nested Case-Control Study; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Obesity; obesity in children; offspring; parity; Perinatal; Persons; Physical activity; Policies; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prevalence; Prevention strategy; Production; Propane; prospective; Prospective Studies; public health medicine (field); Questionnaires; Race; Regulation; Reporting; Resources; Risk; sample collection; screening; Smoking; Specimen; Translating; Triglycerides; urinary; Urine; Visit; Woman; Youth; ","PROJECT_TITLE":"Prenatal Bisphenol A Exposure and Risk of Gestational Diabetes","SERIAL_NUMBER":19196,"STUDY_SECTION":"KNOD","STUDY_SECTION_NAME":"Kidney, Nutrition, Obesity and Diabetes ","SUBPROJECT_ID":null,"SUFFIX":null,"SUPPORT_YEAR":4,"DIRECT_COST_AMT":405011.0,"INDIRECT_COST_AMT":198902.0,"TOTAL_COST":603913.0,"TOTAL_COST_SUB_PROJECT":null},

The TIGAR catalytic activity converts F2,6-P2 to F6-P and appears to be constitutive dependent upon TIGAR expression levels. As phosphofructose kinase 1 (PFK1) is the rate limiting step in glycolysis and F2,6-P2 is a potent PFK1 allosteric regulator, Tigar and the PFKFB's are thought to control the relative rate of carbon flux through the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways, that is high PFK-1 activity drives glycolysis whereas low PFK-1 activity shifts F6-P to the pentose phosphate pathway. More recently, it was reported that TIGAR is also a 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3BPG) phosphatase although the biological role for 2,3BPG has only been shown in erythrocytes and placenta in promoting the release of oxygen from hemaglobin. In any case, the biological properties and function of TIGAR have primarily been studied in vitro and in cultured tumor cell lines based upon its the F2,6-P phosphatase (FBPase) activity to reduce F2,6-P2 levels and suppress glycolysis. However, we have identified a novel and paradigm shifting function for TIGAR in adipocyte biology. Our preliminary data has demonstrated that TIGAR is highly expressed in adipocytes and is markedly down regulated in ob\/ob and db\/db mice and following high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Moreover, knockdown of TIGAR in 3T3L1 adipocytes resulted in marked inhibition of insulin signaling with increased basal and TNF? stimulated NF-?B signaling. In contrast, over expression of TIGAR enhanced insulin signaling and inhibited basal and TNF?-stimulated NF-?B signaling. Detailed analyses demonstrated that TIGAR suppressed NF-?B signaling upstream of IKK? and surprisingly independent of the TIGAR phosphatase enzymatic activity. Based upon these data and recent preliminary data, we hypothesize that TIGAR suppresses NF-?B signaling through inhibition of the upstream IKK?\/IKK?\/NEMO ternary complex by directly binding to the HOIL\/HOIP-1L\/Sharpin complex responsible for NEMO and RIP1 linear ubiquitination. We further predict the preventing\/reversing diet induced obesity down regulation of adipocyte TIGAR protein will protect adipocytes\/adipose tissue from metabolic dysfunction. Thus, three central questions of this proposal are 1) what is the molecular basis for TIGAR inhibition of NF-?B signaling, 2) does TIGAR deficiency cause, contribute to or is a consequence of impaired insulin signaling through promotion of inflammatory signaling; and 3) can physiologic re-expression of TIGAR suppress adipocyte dysfunction in diet induced obesity and insulin resistance.upstream of IKK\u07e0and surprisingly independent of the TIGAR phosphatase enzymatic activity.

Our work aims to characterize how developmental perturbations of the AHR pathway (i.e. agonist exposure or ablation of the receptor) affect the cardiovascular system in the mammalian embryo, how such effects may underlie congenital heart disease, and what ramifications this has for adult health.","PI_IDS":"1867525 (contact); 10343314; ","PI_NAMEs":"PUGA, ALVARO  (contact); RUBINSTEIN, JACK ;","PROGRAM_OFFICER_NAME":"CHADWICK, LISA ","PROJECT_START":"11\/10\/2014","PROJECT_END":"10\/31\/2019","PROJECT_TERMS":"Ablation; activating transcription factor; Address; Adult; Affect; Agonist; analytical tool; Apoptosis; Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor; Biological Testing; Birth; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; cardiogenesis; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; Cell Cycle; Cell Lineage; Chickens; chromatin remodeling; Code; Complement; Complex; computerized tools; Congenital Abnormality; Congenital Heart Defects; congenital heart disorder; Cytochromes; deep sequencing; Depressed mood; Development; Dioxins; Disease; Disease Outcome; Disease susceptibility; DNA Methylation; Drug Metabolic Detoxication; Echocardiography; Embryo; embryo tissue; Embryonic Development; embryonic stem cell; environmental agent; Enzymes; Epidemiologic Studies; Epigenetic Process; exposed human population; Exposure to; Family; fetal; Fetus; Frequencies (time pattern); gene environment interaction; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; gene induction; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic Polymorphism; genome-wide; Goals; Growth Factor; Health; Heart; Heart Diseases; Heart failure; Homeobox; Homeostasis; Human; Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome; in utero; infant death; Infant Mortality; Injury; Knockout Mice; Lead; Life; Ligands; Long-Term Effects; Maintenance; malformation; Maternal Exposure; Mediating; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; Mortality Vital Statistics; Mus; Mutation; Neonatal; neonatal death; Organ; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Perinatal Exposure; Phase; Phenotype; Physiological; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy; Prevention; programs; pup; receptor; Receptor Activation; receptor expression; receptor function; Regulation; Research; response; Role; Signal Transduction; Source; Stress; Testing; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Toxic effect; transcription factor; Ultrasonography; Variant; Work; Zebrafish; ","PROJECT_TITLE":"Gene-Environment Interactions in the Fetal Origin of Adult Cardiac Disease","SERIAL_NUMBER":24744,"STUDY_SECTION":"ZRG1","STUDY_SECTION_NAME":"Special Emphasis Panel ","SUBPROJECT_ID":null,"SUFFIX":null,"SUPPORT_YEAR":2,"DIRECT_COST_AMT":303214.0,"INDIRECT_COST_AMT":175864.0,"TOTAL_COST":479078.0,"TOTAL_COST_SUB_PROJECT":null},

The system will achieve application-critical performance attributes (including rapid and reliable sensor response, long operational lifetime, and low cost, all within a miniaturized platform suitable for individuals to carry or wear) via systematic design across all layers of the system and innovations in 1) miniaturizable ionic liquid\nelectrochemical sensors, 2) multi-mode (voltammetric and impedance) electrochemical techniques with enhanced analytical information content, enabling sensitivity improvement, automated drift calibration, and sensing of diverse pollutants with a small number of physical sensor elements, and 3) computationally efficient sensor array processing algorithms for real-time classification and quantification of target analytes. This project would provide medical researchers with a much needed and currently non-existent tool for personal exposure assessment, over fine time scales, adding revolutionary capability to the study and treatment of acute exposure to air toxics, and leading to more relevant air pollutant regulation, intervention for individuals most susceptible to the effects of exposure, and ultimately improvement of overall public health.","PI_IDS":"7084089 (contact); 7083860; ","PI_NAMEs":"MASON, ANDREW J (contact); ZENG, XIANGQUN ;","PROGRAM_OFFICER_NAME":"BALSHAW, DAVID M","PROJECT_START":"12\/1\/2013","PROJECT_END":"10\/31\/2018","PROJECT_TERMS":"Acetaldehyde; Acute; Address; Air; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Algorithms; Benchmarking; Benzene; Calibration; Cardiovascular Diseases; Characteristics; Classification; Communication; Computer software; conditioning; cost; cost effective; Data; Data Analyses; Data Collection; Data Set; design; Detection; Development; Devices; electric impedance; Electronics; Elements; Environment; Equipment; Exhibits; Exposure to; Formaldehyde; Gases; Goals; Health; Healthcare; improved; Individual; innovation; instrument; instrumentation; Intervention; Life Style; Link; Liquid substance; Location; Lung diseases; Managed Care; Measurement; Measures; Medical; Methods; microsystems; Miniaturization; miniaturize; Modeling; Monitor; monitoring device; Mortality Vital Statistics; multidisciplinary; nitrobenzene; novel; operation; Outcome; Ozone; Performance; pollutant; Pollution; Prevention; Process; public health medicine (field); Regulation; Relative (related person); Reporting; Research Personnel; respiratory; response; sensor; Services; signal processing; Signal Transduction; Source; Spatial Distribution; Staging; stem; Structure; Study models; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Thumb structure; Time; tool; Toxic effect; Toxin; volatile organic compound; ","PROJECT_TITLE":"Wearable Microsystem Array for Acute Pollutant Exposure Assessment","SERIAL_NUMBER":22302,"STUDY_SECTION":"ISD","STUDY_SECTION_NAME":"Instrumentation and Systems Development Study Section ","SUBPROJECT_ID":null,"SUFFIX":null,"SUPPORT_YEAR":3,"DIRECT_COST_AMT":404328.0,"INDIRECT_COST_AMT":73130.0,"TOTAL_COST":477458.0,"TOTAL_COST_SUB_PROJECT":null},
